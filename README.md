\# PV NodeJS Layer 7 Load Tester \& HTTP/2 Attack Tool



\*\*pv\_http.js\*\* is a powerful Node.js script for flexible Layer 7 load testing and security auditing of web servers. It automatically detects and utilizes HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3, and features multiple operational modes: a standard load test that mimics realistic browser traffic and two distinct HTTP/2 attack modes for resilience checking. With features like randomized TLS profiles, adaptive delays, and detailed real-time monitoring, it is well-suited for stress testing, benchmarking, and protocol security research.



It includes implementations for the following HTTP/2 vulnerabilities:



&nbsp; \* \*\*Rapid Reset Attack\*\* (`--attack rapid-reset`): Exploits CVE-2023-44487 by rapidly opening and canceling streams.

&nbsp; \* \*\*MadeYouReset Attack\*\* (`--attack madeyoureset`): Triggers a server-side stream reset by sending a deliberately oversized data frame, testing protocol error handling.

\## Features



&nbsp; - \*\*Multi-Protocol Support:\*\* Automatically detects and uses HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. Can be forced to use specific protocols.

&nbsp; - \*\*Dual HTTP/2 Attack Modes:\*\* Includes both client-side (`rapid-reset`) and server-side (`madeyoureset`) stream reset attacks.

&nbsp; - \*\*Realistic Traffic Simulation:\*\*

&nbsp;     - Randomizes `User-Agent`, `Referer`, and `Accept` headers from a list of modern browsers.

&nbsp;     - Rotates through distinct TLS profiles (ciphers, sigalgs) to mimic clients like Chrome and Firefox.

&nbsp;     - Sends requests in bursts with randomized "think time" to avoid uniform, robotic patterns.

&nbsp; - \*\*Adaptive Delay:\*\* Optionally enables a backoff mechanism that slows down requests to a target if it returns blocking status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests), then gradually speeds up again.

&nbsp; - \*\*Configurable \& Concurrent:\*\* Control the test duration and number of parallel threads.

&nbsp; - \*\*Real-Time Monitoring:\*\* A colorful, clean CLI dashboard shows live stats including RPS, latency, status code breakdowns per protocol, and a recent event log.

&nbsp; - \*\*Modern \& Performant:\*\* Built with modern Node.js features and the high-performance `undici` HTTP client.

\## Usage



First, install the required dependencies:



```sh

npm install yargs chalk undici

or

npm install yargs@17 chalk@4 undici

```



Then, run the script with a target URL and any desired options:



```sh

node pv\_http.js --url <target-url> \[options]

```



\### Options



| Option | Alias | Description | Default |

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| `--url` | `-u` | Target URL (required). | |

| `--time` | `-t` | Test duration in minutes. | `1` |

| `--conc` | `-c` | Concurrency / number of parallel threads. | `50` |

| `--attack` | `-a` | Specify the HTTP/2 attack mode. Choices: `none`, `rapid-reset`, `madeyoureset`. | `none` |

| `--protocol`| `-p` | Force specific protocols, bypassing auto-detection (e.g., "2,3"). | (auto) |

| `--adaptive-delay`| `-ad` | Enable adaptive delay based on blocking status codes (4xx). | `false` |

| `--help` | `-h` | Show help and usage information. | |

\### Example Commands



\#### \*\*Standard Load Test\*\*



A 5-minute load test with 100 concurrent workers, using auto-detected protocols.



```sh

node pv\_http.js -u https://example.com -t 5 -c 100

```



\#### \*\*Force Protocols\*\*



Run a test using only HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, splitting concurrency between them.



```sh

node pv\_http.js -u https://example.com --protocol "1.1,2"

```



\#### \*\*Rapid Reset Attack\*\*



Launch the CVE-2023-44487 (Rapid Reset) attack.



```sh

node pv\_http.js -u https://example.com -a rapid-reset

```



\#### \*\*MadeYouReset Attack\*\*



Launch the MadeYouReset attack to trigger server-side resets.



```sh

node pv\_http.js -u https://example.com -a madeyoureset

```



\#### \*\*Test with Adaptive Delay\*\*



Run a standard load test that will automatically slow down if the server starts blocking requests.



```sh

node pv\_http.js -u https://api.example.com --adaptive-delay

```

\## Requirements



&nbsp; - \*\*Node.js\*\* v16 or later.

&nbsp; - \*\*NPM Packages:\*\* `yargs`, `chalk`, `undici`.
